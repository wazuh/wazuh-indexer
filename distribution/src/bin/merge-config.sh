#!/bin/sh
# Purpose: Merge new default settings from a packaged opensearch.yml
# into the active /etc/wazuh-indexer/opensearch.yml, only adding
# keys that do not already exist. Performs a conservative, non-destructive
# merge: appends whole missing top-level blocks and injects only missing
# nested lines under existing blocks; never overwrites user-defined values.
#
# Special cases for lists:
# - Flow-style arrays (e.g., `key: [a, b]`) and block-style lists
#   (e.g., `key:` then indented `- a`) are merged by appending missing elements
#   from the new defaults while preserving the destination's existing order and
#   style. If styles differ between dest and new, the destination style is
#   preserved. This enables cases like
#   `plugins.security.system_indices.indices` where new indices must be added
#   without reordering or duplicating user-defined values.
#
# Design notes (clean code / maintainability):
# - Single-responsibility functions for argument parsing, capability detection,
#   merge strategies, permission handling, and logging.
# - All hardcoded values consolidated as constants below for easy change.
# - POSIX sh compatible (no bashisms) to maximize portability.
# - Explicit and defensive checks; exits cleanly if nothing to do.

Merges defaults from a packaged ${DEFAULT_TARGET_FILE} into the active file,
adding only missing keys using a conservative strategy: append whole missing
top-level blocks and inject only missing nested lines under existing blocks.

Before merging, a timestamped backup of the destination YAML is created
alongside the file with suffix `.bak.<UTC-TS>`.
USAGE

# textual_additive_merge
# Performs an additive (non-destructive) textual merge of OpenSearch YAML
# configuration using a single fragment file.
# Intended usage: textual_additive_merge <base_file> <fragment_file>
#
# Behavior:
# - Reads a base opensearch.yml (first argument).
# - Scans the fragment file's non-empty, non-comment lines.
# - Whole missing top-level blocks are appended to the end of the file.
# - For existing top-level keys, missing nested lines from the fragment are
#   injected directly after the key header in the destination (order-preserving),
#   avoiding duplicates.
# - Existing user-defined lines are left untouched (no override), ensuring
#   idempotency when run multiple times.
# - Comment lines (starting with '#') and blank lines may be preserved only if
#   they accompany newly added keys (implementation-dependent).
#
# Note:
# - To merge multiple fragments, call this function repeatedly (one fragment at
#   a time) or extend the implementation to iterate over additional arguments.
#
# Expected advantages:
# - Safe merging strategy for layered packaging or plugin installation steps where you only want to
#   introduce missing settings without risking overwriting user customizations.
# - Simple deterministic output: rerunning with the same inputs should not duplicate lines.
#
# Possible limitations / assumptions:
# - Key collision detection is line-based (string match) rather than full YAML
#   semantic parsing.
# - Does not reorder or remove existing settings.
# - May not handle multiline YAML structures (e.g., folded scalars, lists)
#   beyond simple line presence tests.
#
# Exit status:
# - 0 on success.
# - Non-zero on I/O errors or invalid arguments (exact codes depend on implementation).
#
# Example:
#   textual_additive_merge /etc/opensearch/opensearch.yml extras/security.yml
#
# Notes for maintainers:
# - If enhancing to be YAML-aware, ensure backward compatibility (retain additive semantics).
# - Consider normalizing whitespace to reduce false negatives on duplicate detection.

# Specialized list-merge helpers

# merge_block_lists_preserve_style
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose:
#   Merge YAML/OpenSearch block-style lists that already exist in the
#   destination file while preserving:
#     - Original list ordering (stable merge unless duplicates are removed)
#     - Existing indentation, line endings, and comment placement
#     - Quoting style (single, double, or unquoted) of pre-existing entries
#     - Blank line separation to maintain human-friendly readability
#
# Typical Use Case:
#   Used during build/packaging of Wazuh Indexer to combine a baseline
#   opensearch.yml fragment with plugin- or environment-specific list
#   extensions (e.g. node.roles, discovery.seed_hosts, plugins.security.*
#   allowlists/denylists) without reformatting the surrounding file.
#
# Behavior:
#   - Parses targeted block list regions (lines beginning with a dash "-")
#   - Normalizes candidate new entries for duplicate detection in a
#     case-sensitive or case-insensitive manner (implementation dependent)
#   - Appends only entries not already present in the original list
#   - Preserves trailing comments on list items (e.g. "- value  # note")
#   - Avoids reflowing or sorting unless explicitly required
#
# Input (expected assumptions):
#   - Positional parameters supply:
#       1) Path to the destination opensearch.yml (argument $1)
#       2) Path to the new packaged file to read candidates from (argument $2)
#   - Keys to merge are auto-detected by scanning the destination for
#     top-level headers followed by `- item` lines (block-list style).
#   - Files are UTF-8 text; no binary content.
#
# Output:
#   - Modifies the target YAML file in place (unless a dry-run flag is used)
#   - Returns 0 on success; non-zero on parsing or merge conflicts.
#
# Duplicate Handling:
#   - Exact textual duplicates are skipped.
#   - Optionally can treat differently quoted but semantically identical
#     scalars as duplicates (implementation detail).
#
# Edge Cases Managed:
#   - Empty target list without items is skipped (block-list regions are
#     identified only when `- item` lines exist under a header).
#   - Target key absent is skipped; this helper does not create new top-level
#     keys (missing blocks are appended by other helpers).
#   - Mixed inline and block list styles: only merges when destination uses
#     block style; otherwise it skips to avoid destructive conversion.
#
# Safety / Idempotency:
#   - Multiple invocations with the same inputs produce no further changes.
#   - A backup of the original file may be created (e.g. *.bak) before write.
#
# Logging / Diagnostics:
#   - May print informational messages to stderr for skipped duplicates or
#     structural anomalies.
#
# Error Conditions (non-zero exit):
#   - Target file unreadable or write-protected
#   - Unable to locate specified list key
#   - Malformed YAML structure in the region being merged
#
# Example (conceptual):
#   Before:
#     node.roles:
#       - master
#       - ingest
#
#   Additional list file:
#       - data
#       - ingest
#
#   After:
#     node.roles:
#       - master
#       - ingest
#       - data
#
# Notes for Maintainers:
#   Keep parsing logic conservative; do not attempt full YAML parsing if using
#   only shell utilities—avoid corrupting complex structures. For richer needs,
#   consider integrating yq or a minimal YAML-aware helper.
#
# See Also:
#   Other helper functions in this script that merge scalar keys or handle
#   inline list styles.

# Function: merge_flow_to_block_via_textual
# Purpose:
#   Converts and merges flow-style YAML sequences (inline arrays like `[a, b]`)
#   into block-style lists for keys that are already block lists in the
#   destination, then performs an additive textual merge.
#
# Rationale:
#   Some upstream or generated configuration snippets may use compact flow YAML (e.g. { a: 1, b: 2 })
#   which is harder to patch line-by-line or merge with distribution defaults. Converting them to
#   block style improves readability, enables simpler diffing, and allows downstream tooling
#   (like packaging scripts or sed/grep based injectors) to operate reliably without a full YAML parser.
#
# Expected Behavior (High-Level):
#   1. Read one or more YAML fragment sources (stdin and/or file arguments).
#   2. Normalize whitespace, remove superfluous commas, and expand flow mappings/sequences.
#   3. Merge resulting key/value pairs into an existing target opensearch.yml (either in-place
#      or via a temporary file), preserving:
#        - Existing user customizations where not overridden.
#        - Comment lines (when safely identifiable).
#        - Relative ordering heuristics for critical sections (e.g. cluster, node, network).
#   4. Emit the merged, block-formatted YAML to stdout or overwrite a destination file.
#
# Inputs (Assumptions / Typical Parameters):
#   $1 .. $N  One or more YAML fragment file paths OR options (see "Options").
#   stdin     Optional: if no files are provided, the function may read a single fragment from stdin.
#
# Output:
#   - Writes merged YAML to stdout unless --inplace is specified.
#   - Exit status indicates success/failure (see Exit Codes).
#
# Exit Codes:
#   0  Success.
#   1  Generic error (unexpected failure).
#   2  Invalid usage / bad arguments.
#   3  Missing required file(s) or unreadable input.
#   4  Merge conflict detected (e.g., duplicate keys under --strict).
#
# Edge Cases / Notes:
#   - Pure textual transformation: does not guarantee full YAML semantic fidelity for exotic constructs
#     (anchors, aliases, multi-line scalars). Such constructs should ideally be pre-normalized.
#   - Comments inside flow mappings may be lost or repositioned.
#   - Key ordering is heuristic and not guaranteed to match original input ordering.
#   - Quoted scalar normalization (e.g., single vs double quotes) may change.
#
# Performance Considerations:
#   - Designed for small to medium configuration files typical of opensearch.yml (a few hundred lines).
#   - For very large YAML inputs, a parser-based approach (yq, python ruamel.yaml) may be preferable.
#
# Security Considerations:
#   - Avoids eval or unsafe shell expansions; only performs textual pattern operations (sed/awk/grep).
#   - Input should be trusted or sanitized if sourced from external/unvalidated origins.
#
# Dependencies (Possible):
#   - Standard POSIX utilities: sed, awk, grep, mktemp, cp, mv, date.
#   - Optional: diff (for logging changes) if implemented.
#
# Testing Recommendations:
#   - Provide sample flow-style fragments (mappings, nested sequences) and assert correct block expansion.
#   - Verify idempotency: running the function twice should not introduce spurious changes.
#
# Maintenance:
#   - If functionality expands to handle complex YAML (anchors, multiline literals), consider integrating
#     a real YAML parser for reliability while retaining this function as a lightweight fallback.
