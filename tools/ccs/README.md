# Cross Cluster Search (CCS) environment
This environment enables the deployment of a Wazuh Indexer cluster with Cross Cluster Search configuration, using Vagrant and Virtualbox (or other supported providers).

It also generates the node's required certificates using the `wazuh-certs-tool` and copy them to each node's `/home/vagrant`
directory, leaving a copy in `tools/ccs`.

For the development of this environment, we have based it on [Wazuh documentation](https://wazuh.com/blog/managing-multiple-wazuh-clusters-with-cross-cluster-search/)

### Prerequisites

1. Download and install Vagrant ([source](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vagrant/downloads))
2. Install virtualbox ([source](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))

> [!Note]
> If instead of virtualbox you want to use another provider like libvirt, the variable on the second line of the Vagrantfile should be changed to the name of the desired provider.

## Wazuh Version Configuration

The Wazuh version is set in the first line of the `Vagrantfile` within the variable `version`. You can change it to your desired version, for example:

```
version = "4.12.0"
```

This version is passed to the `node-start.sh` script during provisioning.

## Infrastructure Overview
The environment includes the following nodes:

- ccs: Main control node (Cross Cluster Search)
- cluster_a: Cluster A node
- cluster_b: Cluster B node

Each node is configured with its IP address, hostname, and system resources (RAM, CPUs).

## Requirements:
| Node      | RAM      | CPU        |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| ccs       | 4 GB     | 4 cores    |
| cluster_a | 4 GB     | 4 cores    |
| cluster_b | 4 GB     | 4 cores    |


## Usage

1. Navigate to the environment's root directory
   ```bash
   cd tools
   ```
2. Initialize the environment
   ```bash
   vagrant up
   ```

> [!Note]
> The process of starting all the nodes and configuring them may take approximately 20 minutes.

3. Connect to the different systems
   ```bash
   vagrant ssh ccs/cluster_a/cluster_b
   ```


## Set up Cross-Cluster Search 
Perform the following steps on the Wazuh dashboard to enable Cross-Cluster Search from the CCS environment to the remote clusters.

1. Log in to the Wazuh dashboard using the login credentials:
```
URL: https://192.168.56.10
Username: admin
Password: admin
```
2. Select **☰** >  **Indexer management** > **DevTools** and run the following API call to connect the CCS environment to the remote Wazuh clusters on port `9300`:

``` json
PUT _cluster/settings 
{
  "persistent": {
    "cluster.remote": {
      "ca-wazuh-indexer-1": {
        "seeds": ["192.168.56.11:9300"]
      },
      "cb-wazuh-indexer-1": {
        "seeds": ["192.168.56.12:9300"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Output

``` json
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "persistent": {
    "cluster": {
      "remote": {
        "cb-wazuh-indexer-1": {
          "seeds": [
            "192.168.56.12:9300"
          ]
        },
        "ca-wazuh-indexer-1": {
          "seeds": [
            "192.168.56.11:9300"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
  },
  "transient": {}
}
```

3. Test that the remote clusters are connected by running the following API call:
> [!Note] Note: Change the Wazuh indexer name highlighted to match the cluster being tested.

```
GET ca-wazuh-indexer-1:wazuh-alerts-*/_search
```

### Configure the `wazuh-alerts-*` index pattern
1. Select **☰** > **Dashboard management** > **Dashboard Management**  > **Index patterns** and select **Create index pattern** to add the index patterns for the remote clusters.

2. Add the index pattern name using the format `*:wazuh-alerts-*` and select Next step. The wildcard ‘`*`‘ matches all indexers in the remote Wazuh clusters.
   
3. Select **timestamp** as the primary time field.

4. Select **Create index pattern** to create the index pattern.

5. Select **☰** > **Dashboard management** > **App Settings**  > **General** and set the default index pattern for alerts to `*:wazuh-alerts-*` in the **Index pattern** field.

6. Select the `*:wazuh-alerts-*` index pattern and toggle the API between Cluster A and B to view alerts from both remote clusters.

### Configure the `wazuh-states-vulnerabilities*` index pattern
1. Select **☰** > **Dashboard management** > **Dashboard Management**  > **Index patterns** and select **Create index pattern** to add the index patterns for the remote clusters.

2. Add the index pattern name using the format `*:wazuh-states-vulnerabilities-*` and select **Next step**.  The wildcard ‘`*`‘ matches all indexers in the remote Wazuh clusters.

3. Select **package.installed** as the primary time field. This will show you when the vulnerable package was installed.

4. Select **Create index pattern** to create the index pattern.

5. Select **☰** > **Dashboard management** > **App Settings**  > **Vulnerabilities** and set the default index pattern for vulnerabilities to `*:wazuh-states-vulnerabilities-*` in the **Index pattern** field.
## Cleanup

After the testing session is complete you can stop or destroy the environment as you wish:

- Stop the environment:
  ```bash
  vagrant halt
  ```
- Destroy the environment:
  ```bash
  vagrant destroy -f
  ```
